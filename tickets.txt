=== Ticket 1

@brief:
Rearrange the folder structure of this repository, to make it easier for other users to use it as a submodule in their project.

@status: TODO

@date:
- created on 2025-02-13
- updated on 2025-02-23

@details:
The role of this container is for providing development environment---it is NOT a real *app* image.
The basic idea is that a dev. container and the real project should be managed separately---the container is NOT intrinsic to the project itself, it is just a convenient tool to provide an isolated environment.

The current way to use this repository is to copy the `.devcontainer` folder to the root of the project folder.
It would be more streamlined if the user could just add this repository as a submodule, such that this whole repository just becomes that `.devcontainer` folder in the project folder.

The advantage of this approach is that the user can easily update the dev. container by pulling the latest changes from this repository.
Although one can also use a symlink to the `.devcontainer` folder in the current form to the project folder's `.devcontainer` folder, the content itself will NOT accessible from inside the container, since the symlink will not work across file systems.
This may be a disappointment since VS Code allow direct "hot" update the configuration of a "devcontainer".
